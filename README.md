# DES-CBC
Implementation of DES in CBC mode using Java

All the three codes are required to be implemented in a single package.
The "DESCBC.java" file is the main file whereas the "Encrypt.java" file and the "Decrypt.java" file are the files required to carryout the encryption and decryption part as directed by the user from the main class/file (DESCBC.java).

The Key will be printed along with the cipher text which has to be shared to the receiver by the sender. The length of the key will be of 12 characters. 

For decryption, the receiver will enter the cipher text generated by the sender and the same key used by the sender.
Then the user will get the plaintext message.

Note:
(1) It is advised to verify whether the key is working fine by performing both the processes before sharing the cipher text and the key so as there will not be any error while decrypting on the receiver's side.
(2) In this code the 'IV parameter' has been given a default value but if you are interested in making the code more secure then you may take the input for the 'IV parameter' as well from the user. 

The same project with a GUI will be shared soon in a different repository.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code or implementation?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
